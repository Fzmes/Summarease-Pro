Now, a battery-powered glove could help workers by taking some of the strain.The ""Ironhand"" glove strengthens the wearer's grip, meaning they don't have to use as much force to perform repetitive manual tasks. Its developer, Bioservo, says it can increase the wearer's hand strength by 20%. The Swedish company describes the system as a ""soft exoskeleton."" Exoskeletons are an external device that supports and protects the body, typically increasing strength and endurance. Most have a rigid structure, but the Ironhand is soft, like a regular glove.
